        "---> Easy to learn:\n",
        "\n",
        "Python uses very few keywords. Its programs use very simple structure. So, developing programs in Python become easy Also, Python resembles C language. Most of the language constructs in C are also available in Python Hence, migrating from C to Python is easy for programmers.\n",

        "---> Open source:\n",
        "\n",

        "Programming languages are of two types: -Low level language uses machine code instructions to develop programs. These instructions directly interact with the CPU. Machine language and assembly language are called low level languages. -High level languages use English words to develop programs. These are easy to learn and use.\n",

        "---> Dynamically typed:\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, we need not declare anything. An assignment statement binds a name to an object, and the object can be of any type. If a name is assigned to an object of one type, it may later be assigned to an object of a different type. This is the meaning of the saying that Python is a dynamically typed language.\n",

        "When a Python program is compiled using a Python compiler, it generates byte code. Python's byte code represents a fixed set of instructions that run on all operating systems and hardware. Using a Python Virtual Machine (PVM), anybody can run these byte code instructions on any computer system. Hence, Python programs are not dependent on any specific operating system. We can use Python on almost all operating systems like UNIX, Linux, Windows,Macintosh, Solaris, OS/2, Amiga, AROS, AS/400, etc. This makes Python an ideal programming language for any network or Internet.\n",

Once a Python program is written, it can run on any computer system using PVM. However, Python also contains some system dependent modules, which are specific to operating system. Programmers should be careful about such code while developing the software if they want it to be completely portable.\n",

        "---> Procedure and object oriented:\n",
        "\n",
        "Python is a procedure oriented as well as an object oriented programming language. In procedure oriented programming languages, the programs are built using functions and procedures. But in object oriented languages, the programs use classes and objects."
